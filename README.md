# StudyFast.io

Boost your studying and active recall by just selecting the documents you want flashcards to study from.

## How StudyFast Works

We want you to study in the best possible way, especially if you aim to memorize concepts to ace your next exam. Active recall is the most effective way to study and one of the most [practiced](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38461899/) by students, and we aim to have you start as soon as possible. It takes a long time for you to read your documents multiple times and create flashcards from them. We can fix that! 

You can start studying by simply uploading your document(s) and wait for StudyFast to create flashcards from them. You will be able to take a sneak peek at the answer for each generated flashcard, mark it as completed or useless (if you think the question is too easy), or delete it from the study session completely.

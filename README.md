# StudyFast.io

Boost your studying and active recall by just selecting the documents you want flash cards from

## How StudyFast Works

We want you to study in the best possible way, especially if you aim to memorize concepts for your next exam. We believe active recall is the greatest way to study, and therefore, we aim to get you practicing as soon as possible. We know how long it takes to read your documents and create flash cards from them. We can fix that! You can start studying by just uploading your document(s) and wait for studyfast to create flashcards from it!
